# DHPVS: Dual-Hemispherical Photometric Visual Servoing

**DHPVS** is an extension of photometric visual servoing to 360-degree optical rigs
composed of two wide-angle lenses oriented in opposite directions.
The photometric visual feature coupled to dual-hemispherical
acquisitions that contain the whole surrounding scene provide
useful complementary information, showing large convergence domains,
straighter camera trajectories, high accuracy and a high degree of 
robustness to various perturbations.
